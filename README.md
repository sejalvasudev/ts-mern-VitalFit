## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete e-commerce application built using modern web technologies. It covers both frontend and backend development, focusing on a TypeScript-based React application and a Node.js/Express.js backend with MongoDB. Key features and technologies include:

### Frontend

- **Creating React Application with Vite in TypeScript:**
  - Set up a React project using Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
  
- **Defining and Exporting Types:**
  - Created and exported TypeScript types for `Product`, `Order`, and `User` to ensure type safety and improve code quality.

- **Creating E-commerce Pages:**
  - Implemented pages for Cart, Checkout, and Place Order using React Router DOM for client-side routing.

- **Using React Hooks:**
  - Utilized React hooks to handle form inputs and fetch data from the backend API.

- **Managing and Monitoring Application State:**
  - Employed React Context to manage and monitor the application's state globally.

- **Handling Shopping Cart:**
  - Implemented shopping cart functionality using reducers and local storage for persistence.

### Backend

- **Building Backend Web API:**
  - Developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database for handling data operations.

- **Handling Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Integrated JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization, with Express middleware for secure access control.

### Deployment and Additional Features

- **Deployment:**
  - Deployed the application on cloud servers like Render.com for scalable and reliable hosting.
